# Overview of the analysis: 
The purpose of this project is to perform a statistical analysis using Tableau to convince stakeholders to invest in a bike sharing new business in Des Moines, Iowa. The analysis is performed in a big metropolitan area, New York City. This analysis answers the following questions:

 . What is the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders?
 . What is the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week?
 . What is the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week?

# Results:

This pie chart shows the bike users by gender. Over 65% of the users are male.


# Summary: 

This analysis shows that there is a significant number of male subscribers on the application in New York City. It also shows that the peak hours are during the hours people are comuting to and from work, and during the weekend.

Des Moines being a smaller city with a significantly lower population size compared to New York City, a deeper analysis should be performed to explore:
    . the average trip duration by gender and by birth year to determine a method that would incite more females to use the application.
    . the average peak hours all year round .
